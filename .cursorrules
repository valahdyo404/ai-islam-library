## Project Context
AI & Technology in the Service of our Ummah. The web app planned aspects of using technology and AI in the service of dawah and Islamic sciences. However, the vision extends far beyond this. It is about building a scalable and multi-disciplinary project with the goal of creating a lasting and transformative impact on the Ummah.


## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure repository files as best practices

## Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Use absolute imports for all files @/...
- Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction
- Use explicit return types for all functions

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities and components
- Implement E2E tests for critical flows
- Test across different Chrome versions
- Test memory usage and performance

## Security
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Sanitize user inputs
- Handle sensitive data properly
- Implement proper CORS handling

## Git Usage

- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "test:" for adding missing tests
- "chore:" for maintenance tasks

Rules:
- Use lowercase for commit messages
- Keep the summary line concise
- Include description for non-obvious changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Documentation
- Maintain clear README with setup instructions
- Document API interactions and data flows
- Keep manifest.json well-documented
- Don't include comments unless it's for complex logic
- Document permission requirements

## Development Workflow
- Use proper version control
- Implement proper code review process
- Test in multiple environments
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain changelog
